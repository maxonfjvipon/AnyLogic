# AnyLogic

There are some of my AnyLogic models

### Brownian motion
The name tells for itself

### GimmeFuel
The line of the cars at the gas station

### VIRUS
It's not clickbait :D The virus distribution model

### Supply
Simple factory with 2 conveyors 3d model

### RGR
The coronavirus in Bryansk (Russia) distribution model

### TrafficLight
The name tells for itself (3 traffic lights)

### Perehod
And again traffic light, but now it has a pedestrian traffic light that can be activated by button (like irl)

### PS
I hope it'll help somebody because when I needed to find something like that, I couldn't ... Unfortunately, there is so little information on Google about AnyLogic models
